Predictive Analysis of Online Shopping Behavior
===============================================

This is an Artificial Intelligence project focusing on predicting
online shopping behavior for revenue generation. The project involves
an in-depth exploratory data analysis, including class balance visualization
and attribute distribution analysis. It utilizes machine learning models,
specifically logistic regression and decision trees, to predict the likelihood
of a user making a purchase based on various features like page visits,
durations, and special days. The implementation covers both manual and
scikit-learn-based approaches, with a comparative evaluation of different
data scaling methods. The project aims to provide insights into the factors
influencing online purchasing decisions and optimize revenue-generating
strategies for e-commerce platforms.
